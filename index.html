        When we started working on our idea of Colloq, we’ve been excited about
        our new project and the possibilities we saw. The conference scene was
        in full swing, we wanted to fill a gap in the event space and build our
        vision of the best conference platform that we could think of.
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Four years later, we are looking at a different situation. We ran into
      lots of challenges, solved a lot of problems, yet in the end, we did not
      manage to monetise Colloq in an ethical and sustainable way. The clock
      turned 2021 and we all still face a pandemic that not only changed the way
      we live, but changed almost all kind of events. Many are on hold, many are
      now online. Sometimes things don’t turn out as planned. So it is with our
      service. The idea was good but we hadn’t had enough time and plan to earn
      an income from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After much consideration and multiple rounds of brainstorming on how to
      continue with Colloq, we have decided to close the doors of Colloq in
      March 2021. Thanks for all your support!
